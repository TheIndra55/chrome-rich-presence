# chrome-rich-presence

**!!! THIS IS BROKEN !!!**

discord broke this extension with their latest update for more info see https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc/issues/191

Please note this extension uses the chrome.processes api which is only avaible in the [dev channel](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). So this extension won't work in the current version of chrome.

### How to use

clone all the files to a folder somewhere on your computer then browse to `chrome://extensions` enable developer mode and click **load unpacked extension**

### Example
